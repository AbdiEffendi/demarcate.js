demarcate.js
============

Demarcate is an in-place Markdown Editor developed by 
[William Hart](http://www.williamhart.info) for [textr](http://to-textr.com/).

The editor works directly on the DOM, replacing a whitelist of tags with a 
textarea editor when activated 


USAGE 
===========

The `index.html` file in the editor shows a sample implementation of demarcate. 
It can be [viewed here](http://will-hart.github.com/demarcate.js/).  


LICENSE 
==========

Currently the software is only available under GPLv3 - whilst I'm not the biggest 
fan of this license as it is quite restrictive, whilst demarcate is being put together
I would like to keep this license so that any contributions can improve the editor.

If the software reaches sufficient maturity it will also be released under a BSD license.
